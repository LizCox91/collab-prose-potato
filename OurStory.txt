There was once a girl named Hanna, who lived in a small rural village called Oakendon. On her 15th birthday, Hanna was given a pet baby dragon, which she named Cobalt, after the deep metallic blue of its scales. At first, all Cobalt could accomplish was lighting a few candles and hovering a few feet above the ground, but over the next few years, its strength grew enormously, and it was able to fly farther and farther and higher and higher. Hanna would often get Cobalt to fly her and her friends to the neighbouring villages or light bonfires on cold winter nights, but as they both grew older, Hanna could see that it felt dissatisfied with being simply a pet and being confined to her tiny village. Hanna, too, began to feel a stirring in herself and longed to explore the lands beyond the mountains surrounding her country. On her 25th birthday, she asked Cobalt if it wanted to join her on her journey, and it was so pleased that it flew in circles around her village for several minutes. Once she got Cobalt to calm down, she spoke with her family about her plans. They were very worried, as none of them had ever travelled past the distant mountains, but they could see that she was determined to embark on this trip, regardless of their concerns. Her father gave her his strongest sword as his blessing, and her mother sewed her a fine velvet cloak to keep her warm throughout her journey. After bidding farewell to her family and friends, Hanna and Cobalt set off towards the mountains to the south.
